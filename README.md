# Malicious URLs Detection

This project detects malicious URLs and classifies fake news using both machine learning (PySpark) and deep learning (CNN & RNN/LSTM) models.  
It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualization of results (confusion matrix, ROC curves, F1-score).  
The repository demonstrates end-to-end workflows for URL and text classification with performance analysis and comparisons across models.
